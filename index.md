# Haotian Liang

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Haotian Liang, a master's student in **Control Science and Engineering** at **Donghua University**.
.

## Research Interests
- **Robotics**: Exploring innovative solutions to improve robot autonomy and capabilities.
- **Robot Manipulation**: Developing techniques for robots to interact with and manipulate objects in complex environments.
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**: Applying DRL to enable robots to learn from interactions and optimize their performance in real-world tasks.
- **Robot Perception**: Enhancing robots' ability to sense and understand their surroundings, including computer vision and sensor fusion.

I am dedicated to advancing these fields through cutting-edge research and the development of practical applications. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world robotics systems.
